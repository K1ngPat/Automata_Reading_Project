# Automata Theory and Theory of Computation Reading Project
## Pratik Sahoo

This repository contains **Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation** by *John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman*, the text from which I did a reading project because of my interest in exploring this topic.
This repository also contains a short report summarizing the topics I covered and their significance to the field, as a short task to sum up my reading project and assimilate my knowledge. Hope you enjoy reading it :)
